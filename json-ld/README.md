# UVI JSON-LD example

The purpose of this directory is to experiment with how to best represent
and use a JSON-LD data format to represent vulnerability information

There are a few files in this repo

UVI-2021-1001492.jsonld
This file is an example of how to start turning UVI data into json-ld. It's
quite bad. You can see it in the json-ld playground here

UVI-2021-38208.jsonld
This file is a better example. It can be loaded with the load-38208.js
script in the npm directory.
